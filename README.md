# UNIT 3 APP
 - *THIS REPOSITORY IS COLLECTIVELY A "BRANCH" OF MY ORIGINAL APP, WHICH USED ES6 IMPORTS/EXPORTS, WHICH ONLY WORK THROUGH RUNNING THE CODE VIA VS CODE OR SOME EDITOR AND A LIVE SERVER EXTENSION*
 - *THIS UPDATED "BRANCH" REMOVES THAT AND HAS EVERYTHING ON ONE FILE SO THOSE W/O AN EDITOR OR A SERVER EXTENSION CAN RUN IT*
 - *JUST DOWNLOAD THE CODE AND RUN INDEX.HTML ON YOUR FAVORITE BROWSER*

My AP CSP Unit III Project, a paragraph analyzer.
Not *super* practical but is a good practice for JS problem solving skills involving data structures (e.g. Two-Dimensional Arrays) and clean, responsive UI development, relying heavily on Flexbox and Grid.

Lots of unique algorithms, albeit quite redundant, though general efficiency is high. If I had the opportunity to do this project all over again, I'd begin by extracting the user input, splitting it into an array (so far, this is what I have done), but immediately branch each element off into its own array paired w/ its original index, with each array being separated by 
  - Beginning w/ Punctuation 
  - Ending w/ Punctuation
  - Both beginning *and* ending in punctuation

Then split each case and remerge them sequentially at their original positions in the main array and use a dual for-loop matching system to get rid of the unmerged, old elements.
But alas, once more I have ended up coming up with a good idea just as I reached the end of the process - useless. But I guess it's good for future projects. 

Thanks for reading!
